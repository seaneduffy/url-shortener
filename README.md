API for creation and retrieval of shortened URLs

#About
This application utilizes [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [Node Sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3). Essentially, the application wraps node-sqlite3 in promises and includes models for saving a set of device specific URLs related to a default URL. 

When a new URL is submitted, a URL set is created, and a base 62 code is created for the set. When a user navigates to the site domain with the code (ex: http://localhost/cba54), they will be redirected to the appropriate URL depending on their device. If a URL for the device has not been set, they will be redirected to the default URL.

The application tracks the redirects to each URL as well as their creation date. It assumes if a URL is submitted multiple times, it is referring to the same URL, so a new record for that URL is not created.

#Installation

Installing locally is easy. Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Sqlite3](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html) installed.
